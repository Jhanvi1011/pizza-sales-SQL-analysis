## 📘 Project Overview

This project uses a pizza restaurant dataset to perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using SQL.  
It demonstrates how SQL can be used for real-world business intelligence — extracting insights, summarizing performance, and supporting data-driven decisions.

Key analytical goals include:
- Tracking order trends and total revenue  
- Identifying best-selling pizzas and most preferred sizes  
- Understanding category-wise and time-based order patterns  
- Analyzing revenue growth and contribution by pizza type
